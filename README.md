# dollarify

The <u>no-effort</u> financial tracker that predicts your future accurately.

## What is Dollarify and what makes it unique ?
First, Dollarify considers the following data for a given person, company, group:
1. Weekly, monthly, annually recurring transactions such as rent, income, etc.
2. The assets and liabilities in effect such as loans and investments.

Then, dollarify can project your financials on any given date in the future using financials equations.

The beauty is in the adjustment of the algorithm by providing more data over time: providing updates on your income, expenses, investments, cash balance, etc.

This ensures that the projections stay and become more accurate over time by giving the algorithm "data checkpoints" in time.

### How it differs
**This algorithm enables the user not to care about all the small purchases or small financials transactions**.
Most financial tracker base their projections _all the transactions that you made_.

**However, with Dollarify, you may only spend 5-10 minutes every month or so to readjust your data.**
All the rest is being taken care of.
